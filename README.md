# Budgeting and Retirement Planning

![financial_planning](./Images/financial-planner.png)

A notebook for budget analysis was created using the developer sandbox of the Plaid API for a fictional client named Harold.  Basic budget analysis was done on spending by category, spending per month, income before taxes, current monthly income, and projected annual income.  Graphs of these metrics were created using the MatPlotLib library.  A second notebook for retirement planning was created using the IEXFinance API.  A Monte Carlo simulation was used to project the growth of a model portfolio for Harold in order to determine the appropriate amount of annual investment that would satisfy his retirement income needs.
